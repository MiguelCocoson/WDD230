                <p>
                    The Escalante-Dominguez expedition explored this area in search of a path to California in 1776. Father Escalante wrote extensively in his journal, and while standing near this point he declared:
                    The valley was conducive to settlement. The temperature was comfortable day and night. There were four rivers, large meadows for farming, and sufficient fish, fowl and animals for hunting, wood for homes and fires, pasture land for horses and more.
